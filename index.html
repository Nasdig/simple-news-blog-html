            <h2 id="advances">Advances in recent years</h2>
            <p>
            In the last decade, there have been significant advances in the field of quantum computing, 
            clearly showing that we are steadily moving closer to that type of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
            Software programming for these computers is still basic, but quantum programming languages 
            already exist. The theory of quantum mechanics was introduced in 1879, and based on this 
            theoretical foundation, companies like Google and IBM began developing their quantum computers.

            <h2 id="clasicComputing">What happened to classical computing?</h2>
            <p>
            It continues to evolve, but that doesn‚Äôt mean quantum computers will reach a point where classical 
            computers become obsolete. Understanding their internal structure may help, but what will benefit 
            a developer most is knowing how to program their logic‚Äîprecisely what sets quantum computing apart 
            from classical computing.

            <h2 id="security">Security and quantum computing</h2>
            <p>
            One of the current concerns with quantum computing is that it may facilitate the breaking of encryptions 
            based on prime numbers. This is because the third factor of quantum superposition could make it possible 
            to break those encryptions‚Äîmany of which are used in technologies like cryptocurrencies or blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, measures are already being taken, with a shift toward more secure encryption systems like 
            Post-Quantum Cryptography or even quantum encryption.

            <h2 id="futureQuantum">The future with quantum computing</h2>
            <p>
            The future of quantum computing is uncertain but undeniably promising. Ideally, classical computing would 
            be replaced with quantum computing, but that would require developing many elements from scratch‚Äîsuch as 
            memory management or even a quantum operating system‚Äîwhich is still far from becoming a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
            That‚Äôs why a hybrid integration is being considered, combining quantum and classical computing to harness 
            the best of both worlds. This would be a major advantage, as replacing an existing, functional, and widely 
            adopted technology is difficult. A hybrid integration would allow for a more natural and viable transition 
            to the new technology.
            </p>
            <p>
            The future of quantum computing is indeed promising. But how long will it take to reach that reality?
            Probably within the next 40 years, we will fully develop this groundbreaking technology.

            <h2 id="other">Quantum Teleportation</h2>
            <p>
                Another topic related to the quantum world is quantum teleportation. This theory has been tested with 
                particles such as photons, and only in very small quantities. Essentially, it involves transmitting 
                quantum information from one point to another‚Äînot physically moving matter.
            </p>
            <p>Theoretically, teleporting a human being is impossible, as we contain an absurd amount of information, 
                and transmitting all that data would require an enormous amount of energy, in addition to other unresolved 
                challenges.
